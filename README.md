<h1>MA1008 Intro to Computational Thinking: Dynamic Badminton Leaderboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For my project, I developed a dynamic leaderboard application tailored specifically for badminton players, utilizing Python to craft an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This platform revolutionizes the way players engage with each other by facilitating direct challenges within the system. It empowers participants to autonomously schedule matches, ensuring flexibility and convenience. Beyond simple score tracking, the application incorporates a comprehensive set of rules and checks, such as ranking differences, to ensure fair play and competitiveness. This system not only enhances the organizational aspect of managing badminton leagues but also enriches the player experience by maintaining an updated, interactive leaderboard. Through this project, I aimed to blend my technical prowess with a deep understanding of the sport's community needs, creating a solution thatâ€™s both innovative and user-friendly.
